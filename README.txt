Hi!
This is my Capstone project for my high school class! I have built a custom mechanical keyboard from scratch, from prototyping the pcb to designing the case, to building QMK, as well as assembling it together. 

This is my first time doing anything similar to this! YAHOOO

Current:
Soldered PCB, printed case and plate, and assembled.
Unfortunately, RDP protection was enabled, which means that flashing code onto the STM32 processor isn't possible.
